  <h1> Summer Robinson</h1>
  <p> <em>Delta Air Lines Flight Attendant and Travel Blogger</em>
  </p>
  <p> I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2013 with a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition Science.
    After I graduated, I was preparing to apply to Graduate School but secretly knew I wanted more time to travel.
    Instead of finishing my application, I applied to Delta to be a flight attendant, and the rest is history!
    I started a travel blog in 2020, and it is called <a href="https://www.standbyforsummer.com"> Standby For Summer.</a>
